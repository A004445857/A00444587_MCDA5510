I love Somnath because of the temple of Shiva and the beach. Somnath beach looks serene, and one can spend hours watching the waves rumbling to the shoreline and breaking the silence that fills the air.   Sunsets are particularly beautiful and add a romantic touch to the end of a great day. The best time to visit Somnath is in the cooler months of October to February, though the site is open all through the year.
